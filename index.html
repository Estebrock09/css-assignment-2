        <h1>Losing My Religion</h1>
        <h2>By<br>R.E.M.</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>Oh life<span class="joy"> is bigger</span><br>
            <span class="sadness">It's bigger than you</span><br>
            And you are not me<br>
            <span class="sadness">The lengths that I will go to</span><br>
            The distance in your eyes<br>
            <span class="sadness">Oh no I've said too much</span><br>
            I set it up<br>
            <span class="anger">That's me in the corner</span><br>
            That's me in the spot-light<br>
            <span class="sadness">Losing my religion</span><br>
            <span class="sadness">Trying to keep up with you</span><br>
            And I don't know if I can do it<br>
            <span class="anger">Oh no I've said too much</span><br>
            I haven't said enough<br>
            I thought that I heard you laughing<br>
            I thought that I heard you sing<br>
            I think I thought I saw you try<br>
            Every whisper, of every waking hour<br>
            I'm choosing my confessions<br>
            Trying to keep an eye on you<br>
            <span class="sadness">Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool</span><br>
            Oh no I've said too much<br>
            <span class="anger">I set it up</span><br>
            <span class="joy">Consider this</span><br>
            <span class="joy">Consider this the hint of the century</span><br>
            <span class="joy">Consider this the slip</span><br>
            That brought me to my knees, failed<br>
            What if all these fantasies come<br>
            Flailing around<br>
            Now I've said too much<br>
            I thought that I heard you laughing<br>
            I thought that I heard you sing<br>
            I think I thought I saw you try<br>
            <span class="anger">But that was just a dream</span><br>
            <span class="sadness">That was just a dream</span><br>
            That's me in the corner<br>
            That's me in the spot-light<br>
            <span class="sadness">Losing my religion</span><br>
            Trying to keep up with you<br>
            And I don't know if I can do it<br>
            <span class="anger">Oh no I've said too much</span><br>
            <span class="sadness">I haven't said enough</span><br>
            I thought that I heard you laughing<br>
            I thought that I heard you sing<br>
            <span class="joy">I think I thought I saw you try</span><br>
            But that was just a dream<br>
            <span class="sadness">Try, cry, fly, try</span><br>
            <span class="sadness">That was just a dream</span><br>
            <span class="sadness">Just a dream</span><br>
            <span class="sadness">Just a dream, dream</span><br>
